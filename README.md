# Business Landing Page

I developed this website for Louisiana Structured Cabling, a local business based in Lake Charles, Louisiana. 

It features a responsive web design and custom vector assets (icons and images). 

In this project, I also implemented some minor CSS scroll animations using GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).
