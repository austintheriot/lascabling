# Business Landing Page

## About

LASCabling.com is a responsive landing page built for a local business in Louisiana to advertise their services to local residents as well as generate customer leads. Web traffic increase is currently being measured by Google Analytics.

## Tech

Designed in Adobe Photoshop and built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I also implemented some minor CSS scroll animations using GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). Although I believe that templates and libraries like Bootstrap are a fast and useful way to build websites, I tend to make my clients' websites completely from scratch. This ensures that the needs of the client, and not whatever library or framework I'm using at the moment, determine the choices I make in the build process. The contact page also uses my own custom [Email Sender API](https://github.com/austintheriot/email-sender-api) to send the owner of the page an email upon form submission. This eliminates the need for a hosting service that allows server-side code and also cuts cost for my clients, who might otherwise be forced to pay for a third party email service.
